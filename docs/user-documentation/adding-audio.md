The audio media item accepts a single file of the following filetypes as input. 
   
>_MP3_, 
>_WAV_, 
>_AAC_ 
 
We can either add an audio file to existing content or by creating an audio collection and then adding the audio files.

On the Create Repository Item we will leave most of the things as default and on the system form we will add audio as the **Model** and for the display hints, we will leave it blank.
